## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/cybruGhost/livesports.git
cd livesports

2. Install dependencies

npm install --legacy-peer-deps

3. Run in development mode

npm run dev

Then visit: http://localhost:3000
🔧 Scripts
Command	Description
npm run dev	Start dev server
npm run build	Build the app for production
npm start	Start the production server

    Note: Ensure build script exists in your package.json:

"scripts": {
  "dev": "next dev",
  "start": "next start",
  "build": "next build"
}

📌 Known Issues

    Ensure all stylesheets are loaded properly in production. CSS bugs may occur if imports are missed.

    If using React 19, some external packages (e.g. vaul) may not yet support it fully.

    Always test styling after deploying to Vercel; production may behave differently from local dev.

🔒 Data & API

    The app pulls live football data using a backend API service (you can specify the provider if public).

    No sensitive data is exposed on the frontend.

    Can be extended to support authenticated user actions and preferences.
